# RepoOfMissingProjects
Projects 1 and 2

### Project 01:
1.  followed tutorial closely (don't worry, at this point I think we're all clear I need to go back to Product Management while coding skills are honed)  [here is the 'final' version](https://github.com/alee092017/RepoOfMissingProjects/tree/master/Project01-AnotherRedo)
2.  Redid this several times.  
  Discarded Repo's
    - [The original Repo--Will get there in the next couple of months.](https://github.com/alee092017/wdi-project01-GAME)
    - [and here](https://github.com/alee092017/RepoOfMissingProjects/tree/master/Project01-discardedRedo-5)
    - didn't push up the other discarded stuf it's still living on my computer, but I can push it up if anyone needs to see it.
    
 ### Project02:
 1.  [job tracker app-discarded garbage version](https://github.com/alee092017/wdi-Project02-V2)
 2.  full stack rails, for the sake of speed and time.
